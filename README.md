# Claim-Code-Data-Integration-for-Trial-Awareness-Reporting-pen_spark---Azure-Data-Engineering

By creating external table references to production tables in three test environments (test1, test2, test3), we enabled the reporting team to leverage crucial claim information for enhanced analysis and decision-making.
