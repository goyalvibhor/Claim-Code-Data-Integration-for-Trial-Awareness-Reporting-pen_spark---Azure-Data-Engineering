**Executive Summary:**

This project successfully integrated Claim Code data into the Trial Awareness reporting infrastructure. By creating external table references to production tables in three test environments (test1, test2, test3), we enabled the reporting team to leverage crucial claim information for enhanced analysis and decision-making.

**Business Problem:**

The Trial Awareness reports lacked essential insights due to the unavailability of Claim Code data. This hindered the ability to analyze trial participation trends, assess the effectiveness of different claim types, and optimize trial strategies.

**Methodology:**

Database Selection: Targeted the db-analytics-test1, db-analytics-test2, and db-analytics-test3 databases for modification.
External Table Creation: Used T-SQL scripts to define external tables (tblStudyClaimCode, tblClaimCode, lk_ClaimCodeType) within the cta schema of each database.
External Data Source Reference: Configured the external tables to point to the production CTA database (specified as [DbCtaDataSource]), ensuring access to the live Claim Code data.

**Skills:**

**SQL Server:** Expertise in creating and managing external tables, writing T-SQL scripts, and configuring external data sources.
Database Administration: Understanding of database schemas, permissions, and data types to ensure seamless integration.
Data Analysis: Familiarity with Trial Awareness reporting requirements to confirm that the integrated data meets analytical needs.
Results & Business Recommendations:

**Successful Integration:** Claim Code data is now accessible within the test environments, enabling the generation of enriched Trial Awareness reports.
Enhanced Analysis: Reporting analysts can now incorporate Claim Code insights into their analyses, identifying trends, evaluating claim effectiveness, and uncovering areas for improvement in trial strategies.
Data Accuracy: The use of external tables ensures that the Trial Awareness reports reflect the most up-to-date Claim Code information from the production environment.
Next Steps: Consider implementing this integration in the production reporting environment for broader organizational benefit. Regularly monitor and maintain the external table definitions to ensure ongoing data consistency.
